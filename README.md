# Subrosian's Dance Machine IO board
Documentation and source files for a custom IO board for 4 panel dance machines.

This project involves using a Teensy 3.5 and a Pacdrive to handle button inputs and lighting outputs, with all lighting outputs being RGB and being able to have animations instead of static info coming out of Stepmania. 

## Current status

I've been super lazy for the last few years and just picked this back up. Updates to be more frequent until the project is completed now.
