# stepmania-teensy-lighting-v2
Documentation and Arduino code for my Stepmania Teensy project V2.

This project involves using a Teensy 3.5 and a Pacdrive to handle button inputs and lighting outputs, with all lighting outputs being RGB and being able to have animations instead of static info coming out of Stepmania.
